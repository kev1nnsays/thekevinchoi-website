			<h3>Structure from Motion</h3>
			<p>
				Imagine being able to scan objects in 3D just by taking pictures. Structure from Motion (SfM) converts a series of images or video into the original 3D scene (structure) along with the camera's path (motion). The SfM problem has only recently been solved yet it's impact in various fields, from Hollywood to 3D printing, has been enormous.
