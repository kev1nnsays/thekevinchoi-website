This is the first post on my new personal site, built with [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano).
It'll serve as a resume of sorts, and a place to share my thoughts on programming, design, and whatever else I'm interested in.
It'll also be a place to learn web development and create mini projects and live demos (in so far as I can with a static site).

## Design Choices for the Site

### Static Site Framework

I want to create a site that was fast, accessible, and SEO-friendly. To start, there is no requirement to serve dynamic content,
so I can get away with a static site generator, like Next.js, Gatsby, or Astro. I also wanted to use a modern framework with good
developer experience, and one that was built for performance.

    ### Astro

    **Pros:**

    - Zero JavaScript by default—HTML and CSS only
    - Islands architecture: hydrate only interactive components
    - Framework agnostic (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
    - Built-in content collections with type safety
    - Fastest for content-heavy sites

    **Cons:**

    - Smaller ecosystem
    - Less suitable for highly interactive apps
    - Newer, still evolving

    **Best For:** Blogs, marketing sites, documentation, portfolios

    ### Next.js

    **Pros:**

    - Industry standard with massive ecosystem
    - Excellent DX with hot reload, TypeScript support
    - Flexible rendering (SSG, SSR, ISR)
    - Great for scaling from static to dynamic
    - Vercel deployment is seamless

    **Cons:**

    - Ships more JavaScript than necessary for static sites
    - React-only (framework lock-in)
    - Requires more configuration for pure static sites
    - Can feel like overkill for simple content sites

    **Best For:** Apps that might need dynamic features, e-commerce, dashboards

    ### Gatsby

    **Pros:**

    - Mature ecosystem with many plugins
    - GraphQL data layer is powerful
    - Good image optimization
    - Strong PWA support

    **Cons:**

    - Slow build times on large sites
    - GraphQL adds complexity for simple use cases
    - Community momentum has shifted to Next.js/Astro
    - Over-engineered for most static sites
    - Heavy JavaScript bundle

    **Best For:** Complex data sources, sites needing extensive plugins (legacy choice)

**Decision**: For a content-focused personal site, Astro was the clear winner:

1. _Performance first:_ Minimal JS means fast load times
2. _Content-native:_ Built-in content collections fit my blog/project structure
3. _Future flexibility:_ Can add React/Vue components if needed
4. _Learning opportunity:_ New framework with modern patterns

Next.js would make sense if I needed server-side rendering or planned to add dynamic features
like user authentication. Gatsby's complexity and build times didn't justify its benefits for
my use case; also it's [dead](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/39062).

### Fast, Not Flashy

Looking through https://astro.build/themes/ I was drawn to the minimalist themes that prioritized performance and content.
I wanted the minimalism to be more than just skin deep - the code itself should be clean and efficient, without unnecessary dependencies or bloat.
I (or an agent) can always add features as I go.

**Decision**: [Astro Nano](https://astro.build/themes/details/astronano/) resonated with me the most. It's built by Mark Horn, 
who has a great track record of creating high-quality, popular Astro themes like [Astro Sphere](https://astro.build/themes/details/astrosphere/).
