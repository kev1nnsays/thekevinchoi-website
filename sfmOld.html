<p>Structure from Motion (SfM) takes a series of images, such as a video, and recreates the scene in 3D (structure) and traces the path that the camera took through the environment (motion). The structure-from-motion problem has only recently been solved yet it's impact in various fields has been enormous. It has allowed researchers to map out an entire city using pictures crowd-sourced from Flickr and Hollywood directors to insert computer generated characters into their scenes without green screens.

<p>
To correlate the motion between several images we must first extract the features between pairs of images. We use can use the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_detection">Harris Corner Detector</a> or the more robust <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features">Speeded-Up-Robust-Features (SURF)</a> detector. By finding matching points between images we can begin to find the relationship between the cameras, which is embedded in the Fundamental Matrix. The Fundamental Matrix operates on a point on Image 1 and creates corresponding epipolar line on Image 2, which should pass through the matching point on Image 2.
